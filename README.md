Themify Icons SCSS
==================

This is a SCSS version of the Themify Icons which includes mixins to create themify icons on the fly. I am basing the SCSS off of the SCSS verion of font-awesome. You can find themify icons here: [http://themify.me/themify-icons](http://themify.me/themify-icons)

## New Feature from me
1. Add a prefix on _variable.scss

## Install
1. Download and put the themify-icons folder inside of your SASS folder.
2. Include themify in your main sass file  

	```
	@import 'themify-icons/themify-icons';

	```
3. Use as you wish
